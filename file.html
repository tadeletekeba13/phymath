                Physics is the branch of science that studies matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature, aiming to understand how the universe behaves at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.

                We can divide physics into two main pillars, based on when the theories were developed:
                <div class="concept-cards"></div>1. Classical Mechanics
What it is: The study of motion, forces, and energy. It describes how and why objects move (or stay still).
Key Concepts: Newton's Laws of Motion, momentum, energy (kinetic and potential), torque, work, and power.
Example: Calculating the trajectory of a thrown baseball, the orbit of a planet (using Newton's gravity), or how a car engine works.
